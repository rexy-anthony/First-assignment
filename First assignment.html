Before he ocmposed himself to rest, he rflapped his wings three times and crowed loudly. But just as he was about to put his head under his wing, his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long pointed nose, and there just below him stood Master Fox.
            "Have you heard the wonderful news?" cried the Fox in a very joyful and excited manner.</p>
